## Technologies

## Methodology

This project utilizes the **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) method for managing the books in the bookshop. It also follows the **MVC** (Model, View, Controller) design pattern, with the books being the model, the user interface being the view, and the application logic being the controller.
